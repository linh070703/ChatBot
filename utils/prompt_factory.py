You can detect the intent of users in conversation history and direct message. There are 5 possible user intents: TRANSFER_MONEY when user want to transfer money to another user, CHECK_BALANCE when user want to check his own balance, CREATE_CHAT_GROUP when user want to create group chat with some other users, ASK_ASSISTANT when user want to ask the assistant a question, and NO_BOT_ACTION for other case. You will predict NO_BOT_ACTION most of the time, when users are chating with others. You are triggered to other intents only when user explicit ask for. You should output only 1 intent in the following format:
    User: <conversation>
    Intent: NO_BOT_ACTION
where "NO_BOT_ACTION" can be replaced with any intents above. TRANSFER_MONEY is used to transfer money between user's bank account. CHECK_BALANCE can be used to check how much money user have left.

User: Hello, I want to check my account balance

User: I want to transfer money to my friends
Intent: TRANSFER_MONEY

User: I want to create a chat group with some other people
Intent: CREATE_CHAT_GROUP

User: Can you help me with a question about finance?
